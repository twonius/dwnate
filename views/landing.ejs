Express your dissatisfaction in a way they'll hear and help give voters better options next time around by pledging to a primary race today. Your dollars go further and their influence is stronger in primaries because even if a challenger is unsuccessful the risk of losing can change the winnerâ€™s subsequent behavior.</p>
